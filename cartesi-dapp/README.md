# paper-scissors-stone DApp

paper-scissors-stone is a customized DApp written in Rust, which originally resembles the one provided by the sample [Echo DApp](https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-examples/tree/main/echo).

## Building the environment

To build the back-end for the paper-scissors-stone example:

```shell
$ make machine
```

## Running the environment

In order to start the containers in production mode, simply run:

```shell
$ make prod-mode
```

_Note:_ If you decide to use [Docker Compose V2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/), make sure you set the [compatibility flag](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command-compatibility/) when executing the command (e.g., `docker compose --compatibility up`).

Allow some time for the infrastructure to be ready.
How much will depend on your system, but after some time showing the error `"concurrent call in session"`, eventually the container logs will repeatedly show the following:

```shell
server_manager_1      | Received GetVersion
server_manager_1      | Received GetStatus
server_manager_1      |   default_rollups_id
server_manager_1      | Received GetSessionStatus for session default_rollups_id
server_manager_1      |   0
server_manager_1      | Received GetEpochStatus for session default_rollups_id epoch 0
```

To stop the containers, first end the process with `Ctrl + C`.
Then, remove the containers and associated volumes by executing:

```shell
$ make shutdown
```

## Interacting with the application

With the infrastructure in place, you can interact with the application using a set of Hardhat tasks.

First, go to a separate terminal window, switch to the `PaperScissorsStone/cartesi-dapp/contracts` directory, and run `yarn`:

```shell
$ cd cartesi-dapp/contracts/
$ yarn
```

Then, send an input as follows:

```shell
//For attending the game room, send the hexed string of "{"operation":"find_game","player_name":"test_player"}"
$ npx hardhat --network localhost paper-scissors-stone:addInput --input "0x7b226f7065726174696f6e223a2266696e645f67616d65222c22706c617965725f6e616d65223a22746573745f706c61796572227d"

//For sending the move: paper in your game, send the hexed string of "{"operation":"paper","player_name":"test_player"}"
$ npx hardhat --network localhost paper-scissors-stone:addInput --input "0x7b226f7065726174696f6e223a227061706572222c22706c617965725f6e616d65223a22746573745f706c61796572227d"

//For sending the move: s in your game, send the hexed string of "{"operation":"scissors","player_name":"test_player"}"
$ npx hardhat --network localhost paper-scissors-stone:addInput --input "0x7b226f7065726174696f6e223a2273636973736f7273222c22706c617965725f6e616d65223a22746573745f706c61796572227d"

//For sending the move: s in your game, send the hexed string of "{"operation":"stone","player_name":"test_player"}"
$ npx hardhat --network localhost paper-scissors-stone:addInput --input "0x7b226f7065726174696f6e223a2273746f6e65222c22706c617965725f6e616d65223a22746573745f706c61796572227d" 
```

The input will have been accepted when you receive a response similar to the following one:

```shell
Added input '0x63617274657369' to epoch '0' (index '0', timestamp: 1640643170, signer: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266, tx: 0x31d7e9e810d8702196623837b8512097786b544a4b5ffb52f693b9ff7d424147)
```

In order to verify the notices generated by your inputs, run the command:

```shell
$ npx hardhat --network localhost paper-scissors-stone:getNotices --epoch 0
```

The response should be something like this:

```shell
//#TODO
{"session_id":"default_rollups_id","epoch_index":"0","input_index":"0","notice_index":"0","payload":"63617274657369"}
```

To retrieve notices interpreting the payload as a UTF-8 string, you can use the `--payload string` option:

```shell
//#TODO
$ npx hardhat --network localhost paper-scissors-stone:getNotices --epoch 0 --payload string
{"session_id":"default_rollups_id","epoch_index":"0","input_index":"1","notice_index":"0","payload":"Hello there!"}
```

Finally, note that you can check the available options for all Hardhat tasks using the `--help` switch:

```shell
$ npx hardhat --help
```

## Advancing time

To advance time, in order to simulate the passing of epochs, run:

```shell
$ npx hardhat --network localhost util:advanceTime --seconds 864010
```

## Running the environment in host mode

When developing an application, it is often important to easily test and debug it. For that matter, it is possible to run the Cartesi Rollups environment in [host mode](../README.md#host-mode), so that the DApp's back-end can be executed directly on the host machine, allowing it to be debugged using regular development tools such as an IDE.

The first step is to run the environment in host mode using the following command:

```shell
$ make host-mode
```

The next step is to run the paper-scissors-stone server in your machine. The application is written in Rust, so you need to have `rustup` installed.

In order to start the paper-scissors-stone server, run the following commands in a dedicated terminal:

```shell
$ cd ../
$ ROLLUP_HTTP_SERVER_URL="http://127.0.0.1:5004" cargo run mono
```

This will run the paper-scissors-stone server and send the corresponding notices to port `5004`.

After the server successfully starts, it should print an output like the following:

```
HTTP rollup_server url is http://127.0.0.1:5004
Sending finish
```

After that, you can interact with the application normally [as explained above](#interacting-with-the-application).

When you add an input, you should see it being processed by the paper-scissors-stone server as follows:

```shell
//#TODO
INFO:__main__:Received finish status 200
INFO:__main__:Received advance request data {'metadata': {'msg_sender': '0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266', 'epoch_index': 0, 'input_index': 0, 'block_number': 0, 'timestamp': 0}, 'payload': '0x63617274657369'}
INFO:__main__:Adding notice
INFO:__main__:Received notice status 200 body b'{"index":0}'
INFO:__main__:Sending finish
```

Finally, to stop the containers, removing any associated volumes, execute:

```shell
$ make shutdown
```
